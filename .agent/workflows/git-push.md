# Git Push Rules

1. **NEVER** run `git push` automatically or proactively.
2. Only run `git push` when the user **explicitly** asks for it (e.g., "git push", "push to git", "push it").
3. Before running `git push`, **always confirm** with the user what will be pushed (e.g., list the commits or changes).
4. You may still run `git add` and `git commit` as needed, but do NOT follow them with a push unless explicitly instructed.
